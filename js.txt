This is also know as ECMAScript 6
ECMAScript is the standard for scripting languages while Javascript is the implementation

Array Helper Methods 
The array helpers helps us iterate through an array
-forEach
-Map
-Filter
-Find
-every
-some
-reduce
Whenever you use any helper, always use the return keyword

1)forEach helper method
The forEach behaves the same way as the for loop
The goal is to stay away from for loops and use this helper methods
-Iterator Function: function passed to the forEach method

Why use forEach?
It shorter line of code than the traditional for loop

2)The Map helper method
This can also do what the for loop does
-This returns a transformed copied of the existing array with the same length of the existing array
-Always add the return key word

3)filter helper method
-This returns a subset of the existing array ie only elements of the arrays that pass a certain condition
-This returns a truthy or falsy value, the truthy value will be returned in a results array

4)find helper method
-returns the first result of the particular data you are looking for 

5)every helper method
-this returns boolean after a condition 
-this checks if every elements meets the condition and returns true

6)some helper method
-this also returns boolean after a condition
-this check if at least one meets the condition and return true

7)reduce helper method
This helper is so flixible that it can do what all the other helpers can do
with reduce, we pass in an initial value after the function
